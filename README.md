# Particubes

Particubes is a platform dedicated to **voxel games**, games made out of little cubes.

### üïπ Players

Explore many different games and experiences built by others, using your own custom avatar. Play with your friends, on mobile and desktop devices.

### ‚õè Builders

Use simple yet powerful tools to craft and publish game items, worlds, avatars & outfits. Shared assets can be used by other builders and coders.

### ü§ì Coders

Customize game code sample scripts, publish assignable actions, or script a full game from scratch! Show it to your friends, all they need to join the game is your invite link.

## How to play?

Particubes is **not released yet**. It will be available on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac & Linux.

We hope to start release a beta version this summer, here's a link if you want to register: [Particubes Beta](https://airtable.com/shr19FppC46PsvywY).

## Is it open source?

No, sorry, our engine is close source. We use this public repository for open source components somehow related to *Particubes* (tools, sample scripts, public websites, etc.).
